  <p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=13.html"><strong>Considered choices for funding decisions: how to calculate the real cost of donor-funded projects; when to say “yes” and when to say “no”</strong></a><br />Development in Practice: volume 23 Issue 4 June 2013<br />NGOs regularly seek funding from a variety of donors, to help them to deliver worthwhile activities. Often the activities work well and a donor covers the full cost. But sometimes a successful funding proposal can make the organisation vulnerable, by committing itself to additional overhead expenditure not covered by a donor.

  This article looks at a system whereby the financial aspects of project proposals can be assessed earlier, before funding is applied for and accepted - providing a way of knowing the impact on the organisation and its staff, and allowing organisations to calculate the real cost of donor funded projects. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=13.html">More...</strong></a></p>
