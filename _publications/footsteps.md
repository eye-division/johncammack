  This book presents practical ways to build financial management capacity in an international development context, although much of it applies to any non-profit organization. It gives examples of how groups and organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can do to guide their organization’s longer-term direction and improve governance and it describes other financial management aspects that can be built into an organization’s structure to make it more sustainable.
