  <p>The success of any venture, whatever its size, depends on proper financial
  control. This book offers a step-by-step guide to basic accounting and
  financial management techniques. It is written in plain language for people
  who have no previous experience of accounting and book-keeping. Using simple
  case studies, the author shows how to - construct a budget and cash-flow
  forecast; record and control cash payments; draw up an analysed cash book, and
  a receipts and payments account; operate a bank account; and prepare a budget
  and actual statement. Each section is followed by activities to practise the
  material covered.</p><p>Full solutions and notes for trainers and facilitators
  are also included. Basic Accounting is suitable for training non-governmental
  organizations in an international development context. However the procedures
  described in this book are not specific to development programmes. This book
  should be useful to any small group that needs to keep accurate records of its
  financial transactions.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><blockquote><p>Basic
  Accounting for Community Organizations and Small Groups is much needed for the
  NGO sector. Many organisations are small and therefore this book fills their
  need. It is written in a simple manner from a layman&rsquo;s perspective, and
  will be very useful. This book can be summarised as &ldquo;the power of
  keeping things simple</p><cite>Sanjay Patra, Executive Director, Financial
  Management Service Foundation, New
  Delhi</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>John Cammack says that one of the key
  qualities of a book-keeper or treasurer for a community organization is being
  &ldquo;able to explain financial matters to those who have less
  experience&rdquo;. John just does that in this book. He sets out clearly how
  anyone, whether they have previous experience of finance or not, can follow
  simple steps to keep good accounts. This books shows that managing money well
  can be simple and is possible for everyone and every group.</p><cite>Tim
  Boyes-Watson, Director of Mango (Management Accounting for
  NGOs)</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>John Cammack has a unique talent of
  being able to explain complex accounting in an engaging and accessible manner.
  This is another invaluable tool for small organizations that are striving to
  achieve good financial management.</p><cite>Neil Jennings, Founder of
  Accounting for International Development</cite></blockquote><p>Further
