  specific tasks of&nbsp; financial management &ndash; for example, planning and
  budgeting and financial controls, and gives examples of how groups and
  organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can
  do to guide their organization&rsquo;s longer-term direction and improve
  governance. It explains other financial management aspects such as building
  reserves that can be built into an organization&rsquo;s structure to make it
  sustainable.</p><p>Building Financial Management Capacity should be read by
  programme staff and managers of non-government organizations, larger
  community-based organizations (CBOs), and charities, as well as for large NGOs
  and donors working with their partner NGOs and CBOs. The content can also be
  used in training courses, and university and college courses for international
  development workers.</p><p><a target="_blank"

  deficit in financial management capacity is common in NGOs, and there is not
  much well developed literature on the subject. John Cammack is a
  well-recognized author in the area of finance management of non-profits. This
  book has a lot to offer and suggests ways of developing capacity. John has
  pulled it off once again. Congratulations!</p><cite>Sanjay Patra, Executive
  Director, Financial Management Service
  Foundation</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>John Cammack&rsquo;s excellent
  book will serve as an invaluable resource for teachers, graduate students and
  practitioners of sound financial management for civil society organizations.
  This compact manual provides NGOs and small community organizations with
  capacity building measures that will allow for sustained growth in challenging
  circumstances.</p><cite>Professor Susan H. Perry, The American University of
  Paris</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cammack&rsquo;s professionalism and
  extensive experience blends perfectly with his innate ability to be a powerful
  communicator. His writing is very much a dynamic dialogue between the
  practitioner eager to implement and the mentor providing both tools and
  vision.<br />This book is an excellent, innovative tool which I would
  certainly recommend not only to NGOs but also to UN Specialised Agencies,
  academia and the private sector. This book was an absolute pleasure to read;
  if other training tools had even half of Cammack&rsquo;s style, learning would
  turn into practice with much greater ease and impact.</p><cite>Isabella Rae,
  Senior Programmes Manager, Gorta-Freedom from Hunger Council of
  Ireland</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>John Cammack&rsquo;s clear style of
  presenting complex ideas and the use of jargon-free language differentiates
  his book from other technical financial management resources. The book
  succeeds in providing an excellent framework of progressive stages to attain
  the &ldquo;Nirvana&rdquo; state of financial sustainability and impact.<br
  />Building Financial Capacity explains the importance of &ldquo;hard&rdquo;
  aspects of financial accountability such as developing robust financial
  systems and implementing transparent financial processes. But the essence of
  this book is John&rsquo;s ability to emphasize and highlight
  &ldquo;soft&rdquo; issues. The case studies and practical examples illustrate
  the influence of organizational culture and human resource capacities on
  ensuring high quality financial management.</p><cite>Gopal Rao, Director,
  Skills for South Sudan</cite><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Further details at
