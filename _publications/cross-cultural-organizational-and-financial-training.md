  Do you want to engage with people from cultures other than your own in your
  training events? Are you looking to deliver training that is memorable and
  transformative? Do you want all your participants to be fully committed to the
  learning process?


  Trainers entering new cultures can find it difficult to build rapport, and to
  deliver sessions that are culturally appropriate. Participants may be not be
  using their first language to learn. All these questions can be challenging.
  However, training cross-culturally offers great opportunities to find creative
  ways of learning.


  *Cross-Cultural Organizational and Financial Training* offers a clear and
  accessible way of designing, planning, delivering, and evaluating, when
  training across cultures. It suggests participatory approaches to training and
  learning which can be most effective cross-culturally.
