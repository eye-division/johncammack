  <p>Much has been written about capacity building but little on how to use financial management to build capacity. Donors are increasingly requiring their non-profit beneficiaries to have sound financial systems before they will provide funds.</p><p>This guide provides an overview of financial management and the practical tools that can help build the financial capacity of non-profit organisations. Using case studies to demonstrate good practice, this guide will offer practical advice in how to work with a partner organisation to build its financial capacity. It will also detail tools and techniques for using financial skills to improve organisational and programme management.</p><p>It is intended for managers and trustees of non-profit organisations, providing tools and techniques for them to build their own financial system, and for those assessing another organisation&rsquo;s financial capacity.</p><p>For more details:<a href="http://developmentbookshop.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Building+Capacity+through+Financial+Management">developmentbookshop.com&nbsp;</a> (UK) &pound;11.66, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.renoufbooks.com/Enter.aspx?tm=&amp;mode=">Renouf Publishing</a> (Canada) C$ 16.50,&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.styluspub.com/clients/OXF/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=164328">styluspub.com</a> (USA) US$25.95.</p></p>

   This book presents practical ways to build financial management capacity in an international development context, although much of it applies to any non-profit organization. It gives examples of how groups and organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can do to guide their organization’s longer-term direction and improve governance and it describes other financial management aspects that can be built into an organization’s structure to make it more sustainable.
