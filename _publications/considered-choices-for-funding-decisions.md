  This book presents practical ways to build financial management capacity in an international development context, although much of it applies to any non-profit organization. It gives examples of how groups and organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can do to guide their organization’s longer-term direction and improve governance and it describes other financial management aspects that can be built into an organization’s structure to make it more sustainable.

<p><strong>Considered choices for funding decisions: how to calculate the real cost of donor-funded projects; when to say “yes” and when to say “no”</strong><br /> Development in Practice: volume 23 Issue 4 June 2013<br />John Cammack<p>NGOs regularly seek funding from a variety of donors, to help them to deliver worthwhile activities. Often the activities work well and a donor covers the full cost. But sometimes a successful funding proposal can make the organisation vulnerable, by committing itself to additional overhead expenditure not covered by a donor. <br />
<br />
This article looks at a system whereby the financial aspects of project proposals can be assessed earlier, before funding is applied for and accepted - providing a way of knowing the impact on the organisation and its staff, and allowing organisations to calculate the real cost of donor funded projects. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/fA9QF4wYkrMAjwQjc7c6/full">Click here</a></p>
