  <p>Development in Practice: volume 23 Issue 4 June 2013</p><p>NGOs regularly
  seek funding from a variety of donors, to help them to deliver worthwhile
  activities. Often the activities work well and a donor covers the full cost.
  But sometimes a successful funding proposal can make the organisation
  vulnerable, by committing itself to additional overhead expenditure not
  covered by a donor.</p><p>This article looks at a system whereby the financial
  aspects of project proposals can be assessed earlier, before funding is
  applied for and accepted - providing a way of knowing the impact on the
  organisation and its staff, and allowing organisations to calculate the real
  cost of donor funded projects. <a target="_blank"
