  skills and experiences ended with this book's publication</p><cite>Alick

  Zambia</cite></blockquote><p>Strong financial management skills are essential
  to promote high programme standards in international development
  organizations. Many non-finance people find numbers and financial techniques
  difficult, and some just give up or expect someone else to handle them.
  However, NGO managers and other staff are responsible for sound financial
  management and without full understanding their programmes will be at best
  less effective, and at worst vulnerable to going unfunded.</p><p>To help avoid
  these problems, many development agencies provide financial training for their
  non-finance staff, and also their partners. But just providing more skills
  training does not address all the issues. Poor communication about financial
  information, by both finance and non-finance people, often seems to cause a
  block. This book helps people speak and write financial information better,
  avoiding jargon, and preventing their listeners from &lsquo;switching
  off&rsquo;. It explains why messages about finance may not be received as they
  were intended when working cross-culturally&lt; and outlines how information
  can be tailored to different audiences. It outlines how to design training
  sessions that improve understanding and collaboration between finance and
  non-finance people, including partner organizations, trustees, and
  staff.</p><p><em>Communicating financial management with non-finance
  people</em> should be read by non-finance and finance managers and staff
  within non-profit organizations internationally.</p><p><a target="_blank"
