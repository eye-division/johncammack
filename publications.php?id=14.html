	<h2>Publications</h2><p><strong>Building Financial Management Capacity for NGOs and Community Organizations</strong><br /> Published January 2014, Practical Action Publishing<br />John Cammack<p>&nbsp;This book presents practical ways to build financial management capacity in an international development context, although much of it applies to any non-profit organization<a target="_blank" href="http://developmentbookshop.com/building-financial-management-capacity-for-ngos-and-community-organizations"><img width="106" height="159" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.johncammack.net/userfiles/Building&#32;financial&#32;management&#32;capacity&#32;cover&#32;Jan&#32;2014(1).jpg" /></a>. It describes good practice in the specific tasks of financial management &ndash; for example, planning and budgeting and financial controls, and gives examples of how groups and organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can do to guide their organization&rsquo;s longer-term direction and improve governance. It explains other financial management aspects such as building reserves that can be built into an organization&rsquo;s structure to make it sustainable.</p>
<p>Building Financial Management Capacity should be read by programme staff and managers of non-government organizations, larger community-based organizations (CBOs), and charities, as well as for large NGOs and donors working with their partner NGOs and CBOs. The content can also be used in training courses, and university and college courses for international development workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A deficit in financial management capacity is common in NGOs, and there  is not much well developed literature on the subject. John Cammack is a  well-recognized author in the area of finance management of  non-profits. This book has a lot to offer and suggests ways of  developing capacity. John has pulled it off once again.  Congratulations!&rsquo;<br />

<p><br />
&lsquo;John Cammack&rsquo;s excellent book will serve as an invaluable resource for  teachers, graduate students and practitioners of sound financial  management for civil society organizations. This compact manual provides  NGOs and small <span id="v927pinaj40t_4" class="v927pinaj40t">community organizations</span> with capacity building measures that will allow for sustained growth in challenging circumstances.&rsquo;  <br />

<p><br />
&lsquo;Cammack&rsquo;s professionalism and extensive experience blends perfectly  with his innate ability to be a powerful communicator. His writing is  very much a dynamic dialogue between the practitioner eager to implement  and the mentor providing both tools and vision.<br />
This book is an excellent, innovative tool which I would certainly  recommend not only to NGOs but also to UN Specialised Agencies, academia  and the private sector. This book was an absolute pleasure to read; if  other training tools had even half of Cammack&rsquo;s style, learning would  turn into practice with much greater ease and impact.&rsquo;<br />
<strong>Isabella Rae, Senior Programmes Manager, Gorta-Freedom from Hunger Council of Ireland</strong></p>
<p><br />
&lsquo;John Cammack&rsquo;s clear style of presenting complex ideas and the use of  jargon-free language differentiates his book from other technical  financial management resources. The book succeeds in providing an  excellent framework of progressive stages to attain the &ldquo;Nirvana&rdquo; state  of financial sustainability and impact. <br />
Building Financial Capacity explains the importance of &ldquo;hard&rdquo; aspects of  financial accountability such as developing robust financial systems  and implementing transparent financial processes. But the essence of  this book is John&rsquo;s ability to emphasize and highlight &ldquo;soft&rdquo; issues.  The case studies and practical examples illustrate the influence of  organizational culture and human resource capacities on ensuring high  quality financial management.&rsquo;<br />
