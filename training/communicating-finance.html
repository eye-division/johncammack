  <p>Do you find it difficult to understand what finance people mean? Do people 'switch off' when <em>you</em> talk about finance?</p>
<p>Many NGOs claim that communication between their finance staff and non-finance staff is not effective because:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>finance messages are not fully understood by non-finance teams and partners</li>
    <li>training is not provided to help finance teams to be better communicators</li>
    <li>finance is not used in to help improve programme impact</li>
    <li>information is prepared to suit accountants' needs only </li>
</ul>
<p>John specialises in group training, one-to-one coaching and consultancy for those who need to improve their dialogue between non-finance and finance staff, and with partners, donors and other stakeholders in a jargon free and non-technical way. </p>
