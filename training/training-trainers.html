  <p>Training trainers courses are practical, participatory and, above all, fun. Participants go away with lots of strategies for their own training. Courses are supported with clear materials for participants to use after the course. The methodology used in the course itself provides many ideas of putting training across effectively.</p>
  <p>Specialist courses are available for those who wish to train others in financial subjects.</p>
  <p><a href="/contact/">Contact John</a> to discuss your own organisation's needs.</p>
