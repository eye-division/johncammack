        <p>Financial management is a key skill for all leaders and managers. For non-profits for example, strong financial systems can contribute towards attracting sufficient funding and an effective programme. Coaching/facilitation provide a thinking space with inputs of tools and techniques to use to keep the financial side in good order. It might offer answers to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>what's financial management all about?</li>
          <li>what are the key monthly checks to be control of the finances?</li>
          <li>how do I identify a fraud before it happens?</li>
          <li>how do I develop the financial skills of my staff and trustees?</li>
          <li>what use can I make of my year-end accounting information?</li>
          <li>what is meant by 'reserves' and how do I use them creatively?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tutor will work with individuals or a small group, starting where people are. Their own skills will develop over two or three sessions, allowing thinking time to assess how to achieve personal or organisational aims.</p>
        <p>Coaching is appropriate for those wanting confidential input about financial subjects, maybe because their role is new, or that no one as ever explained how to manage the finances, in a straightforward way.</p>
        <p>Facilitation is also appropriate when an independent catalyst is needed to allow creative thinking.</p>
