        <p>The Fit for Funding programme is designed to review a small to medium sized partner non government organisation (NGO) or community based organisation (CBO), funded by a UK/EU based organisation. It will build their organisational and individual staff capacity and, crucially, make them more &lsquo;fit&rsquo; to attract external funding and become more sustainable.</p>
        <p>The programme provides support and challenge, giving time to think and reflect on the issues of funding, sustainability and financial management. It is especially appropriate when coming towards the end of a funding partnership where it is important to leave a partner &lsquo;fit&rsquo; for the future.</p>
        <p>Each of the Fit for Funding programme aspects can be delivered as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/assets/documents/Fit for..(1).pdf">consultancy visits</a></li>
          <li><a href="/assets/documents/Fit for..(1).pdf">training events</a></li>
          <li><a href="/assets/documents/Fit for..(1).pdf">coaching</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are three main focuses of the programme designed for your partners:</p>
        <h2>Fit for&hellip;funding?</h2>
        <h3>When is it appropriate?</h3>
        <p>When your partner wants to approach new external donors</p>
        <p>Where funding has already been refused due to poor internal systems and processes</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits?</h3>

        </ul>
        <h2>Fit for&hellip;future sustainability?</h2>
