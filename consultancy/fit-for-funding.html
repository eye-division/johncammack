<p>The Fit for Funding </em>programme is designed to review a small to medium sized partner non government organisation (NGO) or community based organisation (CBO), funded by a UK/EU based organisation. It will build their organisational and individual staff capacity and, crucially, make them more &lsquo;fit&rsquo; to attract external funding and become more sustainable. </p>

<p>The programme provides support and challenge to the organisation, giving time to think and reflect on the issues of funding, sustainability and financial management. It is especially appropriate when coming towards the end of a funding partnership where it is important to leave a partner &lsquo;fit&rsquo; for the future.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Each of the Fit for Funding </em>programme aspects can be delivered as:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/documents/Fit&#32;for..(1).pdf"">consultancy visits</a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/documents/Fit&#32;for..(1).pdf"">training events</a> </p>
<p><a href="/assets/documents/Fit&#32;for..(1).pdf"">coaching</a>  </p>
