	<h2>Publications</h2><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=14.html"><strong>Building Financial Management Capacity for NGOs and Community Organizations</strong></a><br />Published January 2014, Practical Action Publishing<br />This book presents practical ways to build financial management capacity in an international development context, although much of it applies to any non-profit organization. It gives examples of how groups and organizations build their own capacity. It considers what leadership teams can do to guide their organization’s longer-term direction and improve governance and it describes other financial management aspects that can be built into an organization’s structure to make it more sustainable.   <a href="publications.php%3Fid=14.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=15.html"><strong>Basic Accounting for Community Organizations and Small Groups: a practical guide</strong></a><br />With facilitation/training guide: published January 2014, Practical Action Publishing<br />The success of any venture, whatever its size, depends on proper financial control. This book offers a step-by-step guide to basic accounting and financial management techniques. It is written in plain language for people who have no previous experience of accounting and book-keeping.

This book helps people speak and write financial information better, avoiding jargon, and preventing their listeners from â€˜switching offâ€™. It explains why messages about finance may not be received as they were intended when working cross-culturally and outlines how information can be tailored to different audiences. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=12.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=3.html"><strong>Financial Management for Development: accounting and finance for the non-specialist in development organisations</strong></a><br />Written for non-financial staff and members of governing bodies of NGOs, who need to understand financial systems and statements. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=3.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=9.html"><strong>Footsteps</strong></a><br />Article: Managing cash flow<br />Many of us have experienced the situation where we have a bill to pay, but we do not have enough money to pay it until we receive money owed to us.  <a href="publications.php%3Fid=9.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=11.html"><strong>Project Budgeting - Bond 'How to' guide</strong></a><br />Revised December 2013<br />The guide introduces you to the main issues of project budgeting and gives you a simple process to follow to get started. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=11.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=13.html"><strong>Considered choices for funding decisions: how to calculate the real cost of donor-funded projects; when to say “yes” and when to say “no”</strong></a><br />Development in Practice: volume 23 Issue 4 June 2013<br />NGOs regularly seek funding from a variety of donors, to help them to deliver worthwhile activities. Often the activities work well and a donor covers the full cost. But sometimes a successful funding proposal can make the organisation vulnerable, by committing itself to additional overhead expenditure not covered by a donor. 

This article looks at a system whereby the financial aspects of project proposals can be assessed earlier, before funding is applied for and accepted - providing a way of knowing the impact on the organisation and its staff, and allowing organisations to calculate the real cost of donor funded projects. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=13.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=8.html"><strong>Financial Management for Emergencies</strong></a><br />A survival guide for humanitarian programme managers<br />This guide will help humanitarian programme managers manage financial resources in the critical first stages of an emergency. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=8.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=4.html"><strong>Basic Accounting for Small Groups</strong></a><br />Second Edition, with Exercises for Individual and Group Learning <br />Updated edition of Oxfam's step-by-step guide to basic accounting and financial management techniques. <a href="publications.php%3Fid=4.html">More...</strong></a></p><p><a href="publications.php%3Fid=10.html"><strong>Building Capacity through Financial Management</strong></a><br />Much has been written about capacity building but little on how to use financial management to build capacity.
