<p>'Basic Accounting for Community Organizations and Small Groups is much  needed for the NGO sector. Many organisations are small and therefore  this book fills their need. It is written in a simple manner from a  layman&rsquo;s perspective, and will be very useful. This book can be  summarised as &ldquo;the power of keeping things simple&rdquo;&rsquo;.<br />

&lsquo;John Cammack says that one of the key qualities of a book-keeper or  treasurer for a community organization is being &ldquo;able to explain  financial matters to those who have less experience&rdquo;.  John just does  that in this book.  He sets out clearly how anyone, whether they have  previous experience of finance or not, can follow simple steps to keep  good accounts. This books shows that managing money well can be simple  and is possible for everyone and every group.&rsquo;<br />
<strong>Tim Boyes-Watson, Director of Mango (Management Accounting for NGOs)</strong><br />
<br />
&lsquo;John Cammack has a unique talent of being able to explain complex  accounting in an engaging and accessible manner. This is another  invaluable tool for small organizations that are striving to achieve  good financial management.&rsquo;<br />
